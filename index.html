  <h1 class="intro-header">What is Mardi Gras?</h1>
  <p class="intro-text">Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
    Orleans!

    Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with long beads
    caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
    everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play
    music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential
    businesses are shut down because of the celebration.

    Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and trinkets they will
    catch from the parades!

    Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed. Click on the
    buttons below to find out the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.</p>

      <p class="traditional-text"><b>The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one
          in
          New Orleans, Louisiana,
          consider
          Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany)
          to Ash
          Wednesday.Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.In Mobile,
          Alabama, Mardi Gras-associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on
          Thanksgiving, then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to
          midnight before Ash Wednesday. In earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day.Carnival is an important
          celebration in Anglican and Catholic European nations.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div class="second-photo-wrap">
      <img class="origins-img" src="./imgs/mardi gras origins.jpeg" alt="">
      <p class="origins-text"><b>These origins are found in the customs of Catholic medieval Europe, specifically the
          fête
          de la
          quémande ("feast of begging") of medieval France. During the fête, which was a time when begging from house
          to house was a socially acceptable behavior, disguised revelers would go through the countryside visiting
          households and performing for offerings. This is similar to other contemporary traditional European customs
          such
          as mumming and wassailing which usually occur around Christmas, New Year's, and Epiphany. These traditions
          originated in a time when most of the land and money was held by the upper classes. The poor, at the end of
          long
          winters and short on food, would gather in groups and make their way from castle to manor house to beg for
          food
          from the wealthy, dancing and singing in return for the generosity of the nobles. French medieval carnival
          celebrations also featured contests and races, which may be the origins of the chicken chase associated with
          the
          courir. A few of the traditional runs have whipping and penance as part of their traditions. These traditions
          are traced to the medieval flagellants, who would hold processions through the streets whipping themselves and
          sometimes onlookers to beat the sin out of them. Other of the traditions associated with the courir are
          derived from the folk traditions of pre-Christian Celtic Europe and are associated with fertility and renewal.
          Examples include the use of the burlap whip and the tune on which the Chanson de Mardi Gras are based, both of
          which are traced back to Brittany, a Celtic enclave on the Northwestern French coast near where the original
          settlers of Acadia were from. These traditions were carried to North America by European immigrants during
          the 17th and 18th centuries. In the mid to late 18th century when the Acadian settlers of the Canadian
          Maritimes were forcibly deported by the English, many made their way to South Louisiana, settling what would
          become known as the Acadiana region. The Cajuns, as they would become known to the rest of the world, have
          held
          on to many of their traditional customs, including their language (Acadian French became Cajun French), music,
          dances and religious festivals such as the courir. This determination to hold on to their religious customs
          and faith has been a major factor in creating the atmosphere that has allowed for the celebration of life, or
          la
          joie de vivre, that is so characteristic of Cajun life and culture in South Louisiana.</b></p>
